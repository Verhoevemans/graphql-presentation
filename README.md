# graphql-presentation

Start the project backend from the /book-details/book-details folder by running the command 'mvn spring-boot:run'. This will make the backend available under port 8080.

Start the project frontend from the /book-details-ui folder by running the command 'npm install' and then 'npm start'. This will make the UI available under port 4200. 

With both BE and FE running, opening http://localhost:4200 wil present the UI and allow the graphql calls to be made from the browser to the server.
